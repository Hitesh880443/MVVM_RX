# MVVM_RX
## Implementaing MVVM using RxJava, Retrofit and DataBinding ##

Like other architectural patterns, the good way to organize your code is to use the 'MVVM' pattern. The Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) helps us to organize and structure our code. The result of this is, the model drives as many of the operations as possible, minimizing the logic in the view. In the final, the code becomes maintainable, testable and extensible applications.

This code is demonstartion of MVVM, RxJava, Retrofit and Databinding.

The final goal is, to get the data from Server and showing that in the APP.
